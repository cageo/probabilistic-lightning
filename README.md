Python code in support of:

Etherington TR, Perry GLW (2017) Spatially adaptive probabilistic computation of a sub-kilometre resolution lightning climatology for New Zealand. Computers & Geosciences 98:38-45

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300416304447

The Python scripts produce Figures 3 and 4 as published in the paper to demonstrate the probabilistic computation of lightning activity over space.
